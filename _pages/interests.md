My research interest lies in tackling problems in Artificial Intelligence in a Machine Learning framework. I mainly work in following areas while tackling this issue:
* Reinforcement Learning
* Deep Learning

I work towards tackling a variety of tasks in Physics Simulations, Computer Vision, Planning and Control in Robotics, Natural Language Processing with these frameworks. Currently, I'm also working on Distributional Reinforcement Learning.
