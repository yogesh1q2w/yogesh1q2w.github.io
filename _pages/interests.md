My research interest lies in tackling problems in Artificial Intelligence in a Machine Learning framework. I mainly work in following domains:
* Reinforcement Learning
* Deep Learning
* Some Statistical Machine Learning
I leverage these frameworks for a variety of tasks in Physics Simulations, Computer Vision, Planning and Control in Robotics, Natural Language Processing. Currently, I'm currently also working on Distributional Reinforcement Learning methods.
